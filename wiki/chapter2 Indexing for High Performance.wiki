= Indexing for High Performance =

Creating truly optimal indexes will ofter require you to rewrite queries.

If you index more than one column, the column order is very important, because MySQL can only search efficiently on a leftmost prefix of the index. Creating an index on two columns is not the same as creating two separate single-column indexes.
