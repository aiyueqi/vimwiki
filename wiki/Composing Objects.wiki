The design process for a thread safe class should include these three basic elements:
- Identify the variables that form the object's state; 
- Identify the invariants that constrain the state variables; 
- Establish a policy for managing concurrent access to the object's state. 

Where  practical,  delegation  is  one  of  the  most  effective  strategies  for  creating  thread safe  classes: just let existing thread safe classes manage all the state.
